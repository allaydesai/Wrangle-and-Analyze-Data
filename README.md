# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations

**UDACITY** | Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

---

### OVERVIEW

Goal of this project is to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. The dataset that will be wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

### DEPENDENCIES

The following libraries are required to run this project:

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### PROJECT FILES

<ul>
  <li>wrangle_act.ipynb: code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data</li>
  <li>wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html: documentation for data wrangling steps: gather, assess, and clean</li>
  <li>act_report.pdf or act_report.html: documentation of analysis and insights into final data</li>
  <li>twitter_archive_enhanced.csv: file as given</li>
  <li>image_predictions.tsv: file downloaded programmatically</li>
  <li>tweet-json.txt: file constructed via API</li>
  <li>twitter_archive_master.csv: combined and cleaned data</li>
</ul>

### DATASET

Data was gathered from multiple sources:

<ul>
  <li> The WeRateDogs Twitter archive: twitter_archive_enhanced.csv provided for this project</li>
  <li> The tweet image predictions: what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and will be downloaded programmatically.</li>
  <li> Each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt aquired using tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive</li>
</ul>

### ANALYSIS

**Total Tweetâ€™s Over Time**

Overall, there is a downward trend in number of tweets per month. There are few times when an increase in monthly tweets was observed. This seemed to happen between 2016-04 to 2016-10. A plausible reason for this decline could be due to emergence of new social media platforms.

**Popular Dog Breeds**

Golden retrievers are by far the most popular breed followed by Labrador retriever and Pembroke. This is based on the number of times each dog was tweeted about.

**Ratings Distribution**

The distribution of dog ratings numerator seems to be skewed to the right. Once again this is to be expected as dogs who are popular or have higher ratings are the ones who are frequently tweeted about.

**Common Dog Name**

It is quite interesting to observe the most common names of dogs being tweeted. The top 10 choices are pretty close with not much differentiate between them in terms of counts. One would have assumes certain names are way more common then others. But data shows that there is plenty of variety when it comes to name choice.

**Relationship between Retweets and Favorites**

We observe a strong positive trend between retweets count and favorite(like) counts. This is to be expected as most people who favorite a tweet tend to retweet it.
